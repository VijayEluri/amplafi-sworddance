Provides basic task control mechanism so that multiple <i>interdependent</i> tasks can be executed in the correct order. This is different from a generic thread pool that expects tasks to be completely independent. 

The main class is the TaskControl class. This TaskControl instances have ownership of the various worker threads that will operate on the tasks. TaskControls are given TaskGroup instances. TaskGroups represent a set of tasks that need to run for a given operation to be complete. It is possible that one of the tasks when run will generate further tasks that will be added to the TaskGroup's list.
